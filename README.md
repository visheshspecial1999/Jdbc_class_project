# Jdbc_class_project
Here I am uploading my class projects which I completed using Jdbc.
In these projects I have performed CRUDD operation with MySql database.
where CRUDD means C-create R-read U-update D-display D-delete 
Along with these projects you can also find the Jdbc notes in 'Jdbc_Notes' folder.
